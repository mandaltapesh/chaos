Chaos theory experiment
-----------------------

Three predefined coordinates on a plane (800 X 600) along with an initial point are drawn. Each point is assigned a tuple of (1,2), (3,4) and (5,6) respectively. A dice is thrown. The number you get is matched with the pair of numbers associated with the three coordinates/points. A new point is plotted halfway on the staright line connecting the initial point and the matched point. After many many iterations a pattern emerges !!
